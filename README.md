**`pycense` by Charlie Pashayan**

This program allows the user to insert license and copyright information into source code.  The user can store various named licenses in a central directory, and a huge variety of user modifiable and user created named commenting conventions. 

You can install `pycense` using the script `install.py` found in this directory.  This will create a copy of `pycense` and all its associated files in your home directory.  Then you can run `pycense` through a wrapper script by the same name, also found in this directory.  If you want, the installation script will create a copy of this wrapper script with a name that you provide using the `--destination` option:

   `install.py --destination ~/mycommands`

For an overview of the options pycense takes, view the help page by running the command:

    `pycense -h`

For a much more detailed look at the functionality of the program, read the manual by running the command:

    `pycense -m`
