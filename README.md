`pycense` by Charlie Pashayan

This program allows the user to insert license and copyright information into source code.  The user can store various named licenses in a central directory, and a huge variety of named commenting conventions.  File name suffixes can be associated with a given commenting convention and parts of commenting conventions can be changed either during one instance of `pycense` or permanently in the configuration of the program.
