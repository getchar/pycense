PYCENSE
by Charlie Pashayan

INTRODUCTION

pycense is a program for slipping copyright notices into source code.  It can be configured to insert any copyright into any number of files using any one of countless possible commenting styles.  pycense will also perform automatic substitution of specified fields with specified values.

 
QUICK START

pycense comes preloaded with two simple copyrights, mit_license and bsd_2_clause and five different comment profiles: basic_scripting, c_style, lisp_style, html_style and haskell_style.

So if all you want to do is, for instance, insert an MIT license into a bunch of Python programs, you just run the following command:

pycense --license mit_license --profile basic_scripting --apply_to *.py
